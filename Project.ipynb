I meet strangers for about 3 seconds, but my closest friends (and wife) still consider me enigmatic, despite years of working to be transparent. Often referred to as “123”, the tiniest minutiae stands out, and there is an overwhelming drive to “make it fit, or correct”. People are my drive. Ever since I was small, I have wanted to make an impact on people’s lives. At one point I told my mother I wanted to be a bartender (THAT was not acceptable in our Baptist household!!). “Empathy” and “sympathy” are not words typically associated with my personality. There is a firm belief that “if you want something better, you (and only you) have the power to make it better, you just have to find the will.” “Thinkers” are my heroes. Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem “If” and outside of the Bible, that has GOT to be the best piece of prose ever put to paper ( See below) If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too: If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim, If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same:.
